# Kubernetes/K8s

## Introduction

✍️ I completed docker and started off with kubernetes and thought I knew enough I about docker but while writing dockerfile I came to know I knew not much abbout docker and I need to clear my fundamentals. So did some challanges using docker and planning to do more off them and then will start with challenges in kubernetes.

## Cloud Research

✍️ I found a good course on Udemy which teaches about docker and kubernetes and I am planning to complete it in the next 2 days.
