# SSL

## Introduction

- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their customers.

## Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of web servers and browsers.

## Use Case

- A good use case would be to secure a website that has a login page, or a website that collects user data.
- When you want a secure connection between your web server and the browser.

## Cloud Research

- I followed the steps in the [link](https://www.ssl.com/how-to/install-ssl-certificate/install-ssl-certificate-nginx/) to install an SSL certificate on an Nginx server.
- You can also use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free SSL certificate.
- I also learned about the different types of SSL certificates, such as:
  - Domain Validation (DV)
  - Organization Validation (OV)
  - Extended Validation (EV)
- I researched a bit about the SSL handshake process and how it works.

## Try yourself

- You can follow this tutorial from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-18-04) to create a self-signed SSL certificate for Nginx.
- You can try this tutorial from AWS to [install an SSL certificate on an EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ssl-ec2-instance/).

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was able to install an SSL certificate on an Nginx server.
