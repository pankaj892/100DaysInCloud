# Bash Scripting

## Introduction

I learnt linux basics and also launched VM in the cloud but what if I want to provision and create a lot of resources doing them manually would consume a lot of but with bash scripts it reduces a lot of my work so I can focus on other aspects of my work. It really is a life saver so I am moving forward to bash scripting.

## Prerequisite

You need to know linux and its commands the basic ones would be just fine.


## Cloud Research

I searched on google for a lot of tutorials but most of them teach you the basics and then you are on your own so went to youtube and I found out a lot of tutorials but I followed the one by Joe Collins and also one by nullbyte.
I'll add it the resources section don't worry though. 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I helped me do more tasks in a single line in terminal rather than repeating them and and creating more confusion.

## Next Steps

I'll do more examples on them for a few days before moving onto networking and stuff.
