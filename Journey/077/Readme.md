# MicroService Architecture

## Introduction

Microservice architecture is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of cloud computing
- Basic understanding of software development

## Use Case

- Microservice architecture is used to build large, complex applications that can be easily maintained and scaled.
- A good example of microservice architecture is Netflix. Netflix has a large number of microservices that work together to provide a seamless streaming experience to its users.
- Another use case would be a large e-commerce platform like Amazon. Amazon has a large number of microservices that work together to provide a seamless shopping experience to its users.

## Cloud Research

- I referred to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) to understand the microservice architecture.
- I also referred to the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/) to understand the microservice architecture.
- I also referred to the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/microservices) to understand the microservice architecture.

## Try yourself

- You can try building a simple microservice application using any cloud provider. You can use the following steps to build a simple microservice application:
  - Create a simple web application using any programming language.
  - Create a simple REST API using any programming language.
  - Deploy the web application and the REST API as separate microservices on any cloud provider.

- You can also try building a simple microservice application using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes. You can use the following steps to build a simple microservice application using Kubernetes:
  - Create a simple web application using any programming language.
  - Create a simple REST API using any programming language.
  - Create a Docker image for the web application and the REST API.
  - Deploy the web application and the REST API as separate microservices on Kubernetes.
  
## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I have a better understanding of the microservice architecture.
- I have a better understanding of how to build a simple microservice application using any cloud provider.
