# Git and Version Control

## Cloud Research

I have a git client and I do pushing my git repos to github using it but while using my git repo and trying to push from M instance in the cloud I realized I have forgot most of the commands used in git GUI has made life a lot easier for me on one hand but it also made me depend on it and if given a terminal I am unable to do it. So I am giving the weekend to upskill myself on git and push the repo from local machine using a terminal without any git client or GUI.
