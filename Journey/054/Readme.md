# Prerequisite

- Knowledge of cloud computing
- Knowledge of cloud computing models
- Knowledge of cloud computing services

# Use Case

- A good use case for storage is when you have a lot of data that needs to be stored somewhere.
- You don't want to have to worry about the infrastructure, you just want to store your data.
- Types of storage include block storage, object storage, file storage, and archival storage.
- Block storage is used for storing data in blocks of fixed size.
- Object storage is used for storing data in objects of variable size.
- File storage is used for storing data in files of variable size.
- Archival storage is used for storing data that is not accessed frequently.


## Cloud Research

- I refer to the [AWS Storage](https://aws.amazon.com/storage/) page for this research.
- I went through the documentation of AWS S3, AWS EBS, AWS EFS, AWS FSx, AWS Glacier, AWS Storage Gateway to understand the difference between the different types of storage.
- I also went through the documentation of other cloud providers to understand their storage offerings.
- I also went through Microsoft Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and IBM Cloud Storage.
