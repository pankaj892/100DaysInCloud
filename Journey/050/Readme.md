# CDN in Cloud

## Introduction

- CDN stands for Content Delivery Network
- It is a network of servers that deliver cached static content from websites to users based on the geographic location of the user.
- The closer the CDN server is to the user geographically, the faster the content will be delivered to the user.
## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of Cloud Computing
- Basic understanding of Networking
- Basic understanding of DNS

## Use Case

- CDN is used to deliver content to users based on their geographic location.
- CDN is used to reduce latency and improve performance of websites.
- CDN is used to reduce load on the origin server.
- Video streaming services use CDN to deliver content to users.

## Cloud Research

- I went through the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/deliver-content-using-azure-cdn/) module on Azure CDN.
- I went through the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) on CloudFront.
- I went through the [Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/overview) on Cloud CDN.
- I went through the [Cloudflare Documentation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) on CDN.
- I learnt about the different types of CDN.
- I learnt about the benefits of using CDN.

## Try yourself
