# DNS in the Cloud

## Introduction

- DNS is a service that translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
- DNS is a distributed database that contains records for each domain name.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of DNS
- Basic understanding of Cloud

## Use Case

- DNS is used to resolve IP addresses to domain names.
- A good example is when you type in a domain name in your browser, the DNS server will resolve the domain name to an IP address and then connect to the IP address.

## Cloud Research

- DNS is a service that translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
- I have used DNS in the past but never really understood how it works.
- I tried to understand how DNS works and how it is implemented in the cloud.
- I went through the documentation of AWS and Azure to understand how DNS works in the cloud.

## Try yourself

- I tried to create a DNS zone in Azure and AWS and tried to understand how it works.
- You can follow the documentation of Azure and AWS to create a DNS zone.
- For Azure follow this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-getstarted-portal)
- For AWS follow this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was able to create a DNS zone in Azure and AWS.
- I was able to understand how DNS works in the cloud.

## Next Steps

- I will try to create a DNS zone in GCP and try to understand how it works.
