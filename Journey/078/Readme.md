# Monoliths vs Microservices

## Introduction

- Monoliths are large, complex applications that are built as a single unit. They are typically built using a single programming language and a single database.
- Microservices are small, independent services that work together to provide the functionality of a large, complex application. They are typically built using multiple programming languages and databases.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of cloud computing
- Basic understanding of software development

## Use Case

- Monoliths are used to build large, complex applications that can be easily maintained and scaled.
- A good example of a monolith is a large e-commerce platform like Amazon. Amazon has a large, complex application that is built as a single unit. 
- Microservices are used to build large, complex applications that can be easily maintained and scaled.
- A good example of microservice architecture is Netflix. Netflix has a large number of microservices that work together to provide a seamless streaming experience to its users.

## Cloud Research

- I referred to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) to understand the microservice architecture.
- I also referred to documentation for monoliths on Wikipedia to understand the monolith architecture.
- I also referred to the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/) to understand the microservice architecture.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I have a better understanding of the monolith and microservice architecture.
- I have a better understanding of how to build a simple monolith and microservice application using any cloud provider.
