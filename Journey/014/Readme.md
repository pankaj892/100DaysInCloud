# Python and Projects 

## Cloud Research

- I completed some exercises on python and increased my logic building skills. I made progress in the python intermediate part and I am now able to understand the concepts better. I created some projects to test out my skills although I failed in some ut I improved upon them and completed them.
Here are some of the projects I made:
1. [Port Scanner](https://github.com/pankaj892/Port-Scanner-Python)
2. [DDoS](https://github.com/pankaj892/Python-DDOS)
