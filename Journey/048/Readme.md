# Bastion

## Introduction

- Bastion in cloud is a jump server that is used to access the private resources in the cloud.
- Bastion is a single point of entry to the private resources in the cloud.

## Prerequisite

- Cloud account
- Basic knowledge of cloud

## Use Case

- Bastion is used to access the private resources in the cloud.
- A bastion is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the Internet.
- A good example of a bastion host is a jump box.

## Cloud Research

- I have used Azure Bastion to access the private resources in the cloud.
- Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH access to your virtual machines directly through the Azure Portal.
- Azure Bastion is provisioned directly in your Virtual Network (VNet) and supports all VMs in your Virtual Network (VNet) using SSL without any exposure through public IP addresses.

## Try yourself

- Create a virtual machine in Azure.
- Create a virtual network in Azure.
- Create a subnet in the virtual network.
- Create a bastion in the virtual network.
- Connect to the virtual machine using the bastion.
- You can go through the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-create-host-portal) for more information.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was able to create a virtual machine in Azure.

## Next Steps

- I will try to learn more about Azure Bastion.
