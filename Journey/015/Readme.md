# Getting started with Azure

## Introduction

✍️ I started my cloud journey with Azure and I created a project using Azure to showcase my skills and knowledge. Out of the major cloud providers I found Azure to be more welcoming for beginners with extensive documentation and learning labs. I love the UI of their Azure portal and I found it easy to navigate and use. I also found the Azure CLI to be easy to use.   

## Prerequisite

✍️ Familiarity with Azure CLI and Azure portal and their services.

## Use Case

I created a website which hosts my resume on Azure which kind of adds weight to your resume and gives confidence in your cloud skills

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ Read the docs I can't help stressing on it much. Azure has extensive documentation and learning labs which are very helpful.
  During my project I faced a lot of errors I was using .NET 3.0 which was deprecated I didn't know and after looking the docs page of .NET i switched to .NET 6.0 which kind of reduced my debugging time.
- ✍️ I also used Azure CLI to create and deploy resources in the cloud although you can do it on their portal as well. But I would suggest using CLI as it is more efficient and you can automate the process.   
- ✍️ Now coming to CI/CD part on github actions part make sure to add the correct variables/secrets you had configured in the repo incorrect values will lead to errors and cause your build to fail. 

## Try yourself

✍️ I will be adding a step by step guide on how to create a website on Azure and deploy it using github actions. But for now you
can follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYrBWmkfno) to get started.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ The final outcome of my project is a website which hosts my resume and I have also added a link to my github profile. I have also added a link to my linkedin profile. You can check the project on my github repo [here](https://github.com/pankaj892/az-resume)

## Next Steps

✍️ I plan to learn more about Azure and create more projects using Azure. But first I plan to learn docker and Kubernetes and then I will move on to projects using Azure.

## Social Proof

✍️ Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
