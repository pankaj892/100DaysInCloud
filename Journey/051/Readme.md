# VMs in Cloud

## Introduction

- To understand the concept of VMs in the cloud, we need to understand the concept of VMs in general.
- A VM is a virtual machine, which is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications.
- The VM is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host.
- Every VM has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security.
- VMs are created, started, stopped, paused, resumed, and deleted by the hypervisor.
- Provisioning a VM in the cloud is similar to provisioning a VM on-premises.
- The only difference is that the VM is provisioned in the cloud and not on-premises.
- The VMs in the cloud are provisioned on the cloud provider's infrastructure.
- The cloud provider's infrastructure is a pool of physical resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network.
- Cloud providers use virtualization to create VMs on their infrastructure.

## Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of cloud computing
- Basic knowledge of virtualization

## Use Case

- VMs are used to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer.
- VMs are used to run software that is incompatible with your host OS.
- A lot of VMs in the cloud are used to run multiple applications on a single computer.

## Cloud Research

- I have learned about the concept of VMs in the cloud.
- I went through the documentation of AWS, Azure, and GCP to understand how VMs work in the cloud.
- I learned about the different types of VMs available in the cloud.

## Try yourself

- Create a VM in the cloud.
- Follow the documentation of the cloud provider to create a VM.
- Try to create a VM with different configurations.
