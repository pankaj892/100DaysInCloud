# Taint and Tolerations in K8s

## Introduction

✍️ Today I learnt about taints and tolerations in k8s. Taints and tolerations are used to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes. Taints are applied to nodes and tolerations are applied to pods. Taints and tolerations are used together to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes. Taints and tolerations are useful for situations where you want to reserve certain nodes for certain pods. For example, you may want to reserve certain nodes for pods that require a lot of CPU or memory. You can do this by applying a taint to the nodes and then applying a toleration to the pods that require a lot of CPU or memory. Below is an example of a taint and toleration manifest file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
    containers:
    - name: my-container
        image: nginx
    
    tolerations:
    - key: "key"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

## Cloud Research

- Taints: Think of them as Disturb" signs for your nodes. They allow nodes to prevent certain workloads from being scheduled on them. With taints, you can maintain isolation, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance the stability of your clusters. 

- Tolerations: These are permissions granted to workloads, to tolerate or bypass the taints placed on nodes. Tolerations ensure that specific workloads, which otherwise would have been rejected by tainted nodes, can be scheduled successfully.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

By intelligently using taints and tolerations, you can gain a multitude of benefits, such as:

1️⃣ Enhanced security: Taints allow you to segregate nodes, ensuring critical workloads run exclusively on isolated nodes. 

2️⃣ Efficient resource allocation: Taints enable you to distribute workloads across nodes based on their capacities, optimizing resource utilization. 

3️⃣: Taints help maintain the stability of your clusters by preventing certain workloads from running on nodes that may be reserved for other critical tasks. 

4️⃣ Flexibility in workload placement: Tolerations ensure that workloads get scheduled on nodes, even if they are marked with taints, granting you greater flexibility in workload placement. So, whether you're Kubernetes user or just starting your journey, understanding taintations is vital for optimizing your cluster's performance and resource utilization.
