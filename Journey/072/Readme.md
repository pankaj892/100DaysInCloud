## Introduction

- Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region.
- Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- Availability Zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with higher availability and fault tolerance to datacenter failures.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of cloud computing

## Use Case

- A good use case for Availability Zones is to deploy a set of resources that are required to build and run workloads.
- A good example of this is deploying a set of resources that are required to build and run a web application.

## Cloud Research

- I went through the documentation on Availability Zones in Azure and learned how to create a set of resources that are required to build and run a web application.
- I also learned how to create a set of resources that are required to build and run a web application.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was able to create a set of resources that are required to build and run a web application.
