# Edge Computing

## Introduction

- Today I learned about Edge Computing. Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth.

## Use Case

- Edge computing is used in IoT devices. IoT devices are usually small and have limited computing power. Edge computing allows these devices to perform some of the computation locally and send only the results to the cloud. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud and reduces the response time.

- Edge computing is also used in autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles need to make decisions in real-time. They cannot afford to wait for the data to be sent to the cloud and then wait for the response. Edge computing allows these vehicles to make decisions locally and send only the results to the cloud.

- Edge computing is also used in the healthcare industry. Edge computing allows healthcare providers to collect data from patients and process it locally. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud and reduces the response time.

- Edge computing is used in stores to provide personalized recommendations to customers. Edge computing allows stores to collect data from customers and process it locally. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud and reduces the response time.

## Cloud Research

- I went through wikipedia and some articles on edge computing.
