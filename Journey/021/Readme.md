# Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ I learned about the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and how it is used by Kubernetes to communicate with container runtimes.CRI is a plugin interface which enables kubelet to use a wide variety of container runtimes, without the need to recompile.CRI is required for kubelet to run pods and containers.A good example of a CRI is Docker. Docker is a container runtime that implements the CRI. Other examples of CRI are containerd, CRI-O, and frakti.
