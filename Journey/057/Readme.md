# Identity, Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction

- Today I learnt about identity, authentication and authorization in cloud computing.

## Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of cloud computing
- Basic knowledge of cloud storage

## Use Case

- Identity, authentication and authorization is one of the most important aspect of cloud computing. It is important to understand how identity is managed, how authentication is done and how authorization is done in cloud computing.

## Cloud Research

- I went through the documentation of AWS and Azure to understand how identity, authentication and authorization is done in cloud computing.
- You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/identity-and-access-management.html) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis).


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was able to understand how identity, authentication and authorization is done in cloud computing.
- In a nutshell, identity is managed by IAM, authentication is done by MFA and authorization is done by RBAC.
- In simple terms, identity is who you are, authentication is how you prove who you are and authorization is what you are allowed to do.
