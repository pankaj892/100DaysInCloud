# Firewalls in Cloud

## Introduction

- Firewalls are the first line of defense in a network.
- They are used to filter traffic based on a set of rules.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of networking & security

## Use Case

- Firewalls are used to protect the network from unauthorized access.
- A firewall can be used to block traffic from a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses.
- Firewalls can also be used to block traffic based on the port number.
- A use case for firewalls is to block traffic from a specific country or region.

## Cloud Research

- I have learned that firewalls are used to protect the network from unauthorized access.
- I went through the documentation of AWS, Azure and GCP to understand how firewalls work in each of these clouds.
- I learnt about Azure Firewall from the documentation and how it can be used to protect the network from unauthorized access.
- Here is a link to the documentation of Azure Firewall: [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview)
- Here is a tutorial on how to create a firewall rule in Azure: [Create a firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-rule-portal)

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I have learnt about Azure Firewall and how it can be used to protect the network from unauthorized access.

## Next Steps

- I will learn more about Azure Firewall and how it can be used to protect the network from unauthorized access.
