# SLAs

## Introduction

- Today I learned about SLAs and how they are used to measure the performance of a service.
- The SLA is a contract between the service provider and the customer.
- The SLA defines the level of service expected from the service provider.
- The SLA also defines the penalties that the service provider will have to pay if the service is not provided as per the SLA.

## Use Case

- The SLA is used to measure the performance of a service.

## Cloud Research

- I went through the documentation on [AWS SLAs](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/).
- I also went through the documentation on [Azure SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/support/legal/sla/summary/).
- I also went through the documentation on [GCP SLAs](https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla).
- It helped me understand the different types of SLAs and how they are used to measure the performance of a service.
