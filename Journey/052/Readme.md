# Hypervisors

## Cloud Research

- Hypervisors are the software that allows us to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
- There are two types of hypervisors:
  - Type 1: Bare Metal Hypervisors
  - Type 2: Hosted Hypervisors
- Type 1 hypervisors are installed directly on the physical machine and are responsible for managing the hardware and providing resources to the virtual machines.
- Type 2 hypervisors are installed on top of the operating system and are responsible for managing the virtual machines.
- Type 1 hypervisors are more efficient than Type 2 hypervisors.
- Type 1 hypervisors are more secure than Type 2 hypervisors.
- Type 1 hypervisors are more expensive than Type 2 hypervisors.
- Type 1 hypervisors are more difficult to install than Type 2 hypervisors.
- Hypervisors are also known as Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs).
- The most popular Type 1 hypervisors are:
  - VMware ESXi
  - Microsoft Hyper-V
  - Citrix XenServer
  - KVM
- The most popular Type 2 hypervisors are:
    - VMware Workstation
    - VMware Fusion
    - Oracle VirtualBox
    - Microsoft Virtual PC
    - Parallels Desktop for Mac
    - QEMU
- They are used to create virtual machines.
- Virtual machines are used to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
- Many organizations use virtual machines to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
