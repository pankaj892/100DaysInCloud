# Putting the server in serverless

## Introduction

- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity. It is a form of utility computing.

## Prerequisite

- Knowledge of cloud computing
- Knowledge of cloud computing models
- Knowledge of cloud computing services

## Use Case

- A good use case for serverless is when you have a small application that you want to run in the cloud. You don't want to have to worry about the infrastructure, you just want to run your application. Serverless is a good option for this.

## Cloud Research

- I refer to the [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) page for this research.
- I went through the documentation of AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate to understand the difference between the two.
- I also went through the documentation of other cloud providers to understand their serverless offerings.

## Try yourself

- You can follow the [AWS Lambda Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html) to get started with AWS Lambda.
- You can follow the Azure Functions [Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python) to get started with Azure Functions.
- You can follow the Google Cloud Functions [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart) to get started with Google Cloud Functions.


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I learned about serverless and how it can be used to run applications in the cloud without having to worry about the infrastructure.
- I also learned about the different serverless offerings from different cloud providers.
- I learned that serverless is a good option for small applications that don't require a lot of resources.
- I learned that serverless doesn't mean that there are no servers involved, it just means that you don't have to worry about them.
