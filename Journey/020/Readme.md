# Working with Pods

## Cloud Research
I have learned about the following topics today:
Kubernetes Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes. A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.
I created 2 VMs on GCP and installed kubectl on both of them. I created a cluster with 2 nodes and then created a pod with 2 containers. I got some errors also on the way like image was wrong due to which container wasn't gettting created and this led to my pod not getting created. I also learned about the different commands that can be used to get information about the pods and the containers inside. Overall it was a good experience.
