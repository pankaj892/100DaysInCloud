# Monoliths

## Introduction

- Today we will learn about Monoliths.
- A monolith is a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of software development.

## Use Case

- Monoliths are used in various applications like banking, e-commerce, and other enterprise applications.
- A good example of a monolith is the traditional three-tiered application, which consists of a user interface, business logic, and data storage.

## Cloud Research

- I went through the following articles to understand more about Monoliths:
  - [Monoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application)

- Monoliths are easy to develop and deploy.
- They are easy to test and debug.
- The disadvantages of monoliths are that they are difficult to scale and maintain.

## Try yourself

- Try to create a simple monolith application.
- You can follow the following steps:
  - Create a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Add a simple backend using Node.js or Python.
  - Add a database to store the data.

- You can also try to deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I have a better understanding of Monoliths and how they are used in various applications.

## Next Steps

- I will learn about Microservices and how they are different from Monoliths.
