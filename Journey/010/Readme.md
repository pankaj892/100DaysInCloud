# LAMP in the Cloud

## Introduction

I started off with networking and completed it but to enforce my learning I created a LAMP VM in Azure

## Prerequisite

You need to know linux basic understanding would do fine and also how to create VMs in the Cloud 

## Cloud Research

Microsoft Learn provides a lot of resources to accomplish this but I feel they might be overwhelming for first time users

## Try yourself

I have created a tutorial [here](https://dev.to/pankaj892/lamp-stack-in-microsoft-azure-5065)

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I learnt a lot during performing these steps I even failed in some but little bit of goggling and troubleshooting helped me a lot.
Highly recommend this for beginners as you can use your linux knowledge.
