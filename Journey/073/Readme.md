## Introduction

- Landing Zone is a concept that is used to describe the process of deploying a set of resources that are required to build and run workloads.
- Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region.
- Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- Availability Zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with higher availability and fault tolerance to datacenter failures.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of cloud computing
