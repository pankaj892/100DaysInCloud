# Containerized Apps with Docker

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ I started off with Dockers and completed the labs on Docker there is also a container orchestration tool Docker Swarm which can be used to manage containers but I thought if Swarm exists then why to use Kubernetes. This question led me to search about Kubernetes and I found out that Kubernetes is more advanced and is used in production environments. So I decided to learn about Kubernetes and got myself enrolled in a course on Edx which is taught by linux foundation.

- I created a project using Docker which starts and express.js app on a server and I also created a Dockerfile to build the image and run and used Github Actions to deploy it to Azure Container Instances(ACI). I tried to use terraform for IaC but couldn't do it so will try to do it in the future.
